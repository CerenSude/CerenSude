## Hi, I'm Ceren 👋

Computer Engineering graduate focused on **Machine Learning and Data Science**.  
I build **end-to-end ML systems** — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### What I work on
- Machine Learning & Data Science
- Recommendation Systems
- Explainable AI (SHAP)
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Backend APIs for ML-powered applications

### Core ML Skills
- Supervised learning (classification & regression)
- Model evaluation & comparison
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Handling imbalanced and noisy datasets
- Model interpretability & explainability (SHAP)

### Models & Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees & Random Forest
- Linear / Ridge / Lasso / Polynomial Regression
- Basic Neural Networks

### ML Workflow
- Data cleaning & exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection & transformation
- Train/validation/test splits
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance analysis (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
